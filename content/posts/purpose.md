The purpose is this blog is to be my company as I voyage on my journey to becoming a Lead ML Engineer at 
a big tech company like Netflix. Despite not keeping up with the latest trends in tech, I have never 
given up, and I am going to get this thing done not just for me, but as inspiration for others who have 
sort-of lost their way in life and want to start fresh in the very thing they have been involved in 
somehow.

Now, I am still trying to design a curriculum for next 6 months or so, which is pretty less compared to 
how long it takes to have a good breadth in this domain, but this is the timeline my personal life has 
offered me and I am going to take it and run with it. My office job is pretty much relaxed if I don't 
flutter around aimlessly and just get my tasks done, which seems easier now than it used to be for me 
throughout my career, partly thanks to Cursor and gpt tools.

Someone said "LLMs and GPTs are like sharing superpowers in the hands of idiots."
I say it's better to be an enlighetend idiot than an ignorant know-it-all.

So I'll be posting a curriculum soon, since I can't function at all without structure. So see you guys 
then. Take care.

Tarun.
